      <description>Introduction If you&#39;re writing concurrent code in Crystal, chances are you&#39;re relying on Channels to pass information between Fibers. This works very well when dealing with one-way communication - i.e. when the information flows in one direction only - but probably leaves you wondering how to pass information back and forth between fibers.
In this article, we show a simple pattern to achieve two-way communication between fibers, and then iterate over it, to make it more user-friendly.</description>
